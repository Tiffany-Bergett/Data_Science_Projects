#### Description:
-   Python via Google Collab (.ipynb notebook).
-   7 coding tasks completed plus scenario and recommendations.

#### Process:
1)   Accessing and displaying data from the nested list.  
2)   Calculating metrics such as total units sold and console lifespan.  
3)   Sorting data based on calculated metrics.  

#### Data
The primary data source is a nested list named `console_data`.

-   `'console_data'`:  A nested list containing information about various gaming consoles.  
    -   `'console'`: The name of the gaming console.  
    -   `'company'`: The company that manufactured the console.  
    -   `'release_year'`: The year the console was released.  
    -   `'discontinued_year'`: The year the console was discontinued.  
    -   `'release_price'`: The release price of the console.  
    -   `'units_sold'`: The number of units sold.  

#### Assumptions:
-   The primary assumption is that the provided dataset is accurate and complete.
-   Calculations are based solely on the data within the `console_data` list.

#### Findings:
-   Key insights include sales performance metrics (total units sold, revenue) and console lifespan.
-   Analysis reveals trends in console popularity and revenue generation.

#### Recommendations:
-   Recommendations are provided for inventory prioritization and pricing strategies based on the analysis.
-   Further analysis could include incorporating additional data such as repair costs and sales volume over time.
